# Logistics System Documentation

This directory contains all the key documentation for the multi-site logistics system project.

## Quick Navigation

### Core Documents
- **[LOGISTICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./LOGISTICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Complete implementation design with LogisticsId approach, domain models, and system architecture
- **[DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive development workflow, testing, and project structure guide

### Setup & Infrastructure
- **[TIGERBEETLE_SETUP.md](./TIGERBEETLE_SETUP.md)** - TigerBeetle installation and configuration guide
- **[PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md](./PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Production deployment strategies and considerations

## Project Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- .NET solution structure with Core, API, and Test projects
- LogisticsId implementation with comprehensive tests (12 passing)
- Domain models for loads, vendors, carriers, products
- TigerBeetle integration foundation
- Configuration management
- **AI-driven progress tracking system**
- **Intelligent session management (dev-start.sh/dev-stop.sh)**
- **Multi-machine development continuity**
- Comprehensive documentation

ðŸš§ **Next Steps:**
- Implement LoadLifecycleService
- Build out master entity services
- Add offline buffering capabilities
- Develop API endpoints

## ðŸŠ† AI-Driven Development Workflow

```bash
# From ~/logistics-system directory:

# Start development session (everything automated)
./dev-start.sh

# Optional: Check progress during development
./update-progress.sh

# End session (AI tracks progress automatically)
./dev-stop.sh
```

### Manual Commands (if needed):
```bash
# Build and test
dotnet build && dotnet test

# Run API
dotnet run --project src/LogisticsSystem.Api

# View project structure
find src -name "*.cs" | head -10
```

## Session Continuity

This `~/logistics-system` directory contains everything needed to continue development:
- All source code and tests
- Complete documentation and design decisions
- Configuration templates
- Ready-to-run .NET solution

Start any new session from this directory to have full context.

## ðŸŽ¯ **For Future Projects**

This project demonstrates the tracking system template available at:
**`~/PROJECT_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md`**

Use this template for any new development projects to establish the same professional tracking and session continuity system.
