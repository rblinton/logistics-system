## 🅾 **Immediate Next Steps - Ready for LoadLifecycleService Development**

**🎆 FOUNDATION COMPLETE!** The next session will focus on implementing the core business logic:

1. **Start Development Session**: `./dev-start.sh` (everything automated)
2. **Begin LoadLifecycleService**: Create ILoadLifecycleService interface in TigerBeetle project
3. **Implement Core Methods**: CreateLoadAsync, AssignLoadAsync, CompleteLoadAsync
4. **Add Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for load lifecycle
5. **Optional Progress Check**: `./update-progress.sh` (AI tracks automatically)
6. **End Session**: `./dev-stop.sh` (AI summarizes accomplishments)

## 🔄 **AI-Driven Development Workflow**

### **🚀 Session Start (Everything Automated)**
```bash
cd ~/logistics-system
./dev-start.sh
# ✅ Smart git pull with conflict detection
# ✅ Auto-starts TigerBeetle if needed
# ✅ Verifies build and tests (12 passing)
# ✅ Shows current progress and next steps
# ✅ Detects multi-machine transitions
```

### **🤖 Session End (AI Progress Tracking)**
```bash
./dev-stop.sh
# ✅ AI analyzes session accomplishments
# ✅ Commits with intelligent messages
# ✅ Pushes to GitHub with verification
# ✅ Final build/test validation
# ✅ Updates AI context automatically
```

## 📚 **Quick Reference**

### **Key Files for Session Continuity**
- `PROGRESS_LOG.md` - This file (current status)
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Detailed development workflow
- `docs/LOGISTICS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete system architecture
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start

### **Critical Commands**
```bash
# Build and test
dotnet build && dotnet test

# Run API locally  
cd src/LogisticsSystem.Api && dotnet run

# Start TigerBeetle (if needed)
docker start tigerbeetle

# View project structure
find src -name "*.cs" | head -10
```

## 🎓 **Learning Context**

This project evolved from:
